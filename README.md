# 🏗️ Mini Project: Repository Pattern with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy

This project demonstrates the use of the **Repository Pattern**, one of the most widely used **Enterprise Design Patterns**, applied in a simple Product CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **SQLAlchemy**.

## 🧠 About the Repository Pattern

The **Repository Pattern** separates the data access logic from the business logic. It acts as a layer between your domain and data mapping layers, providing a more object-oriented view of the persistence layer.

### ✅ Key Benefits
- Decouples business logic from data access.
- Improves maintainability and testability.
- Facilitates future data source changes (e.g., switching databases).
- Simplifies unit testing by allowing the repository to be mocked.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for products.
- 🧩 Clean architecture using Repository Pattern.
- 🧪 Unit tests with **pytest**.
- ⚙️ GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing.
